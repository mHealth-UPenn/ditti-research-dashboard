# Contribution Guide

## Submitting Issues

We highly encourage users and contributors of the Ditti Dashboard to use GitHub Issues for reporting any bugs, making feature requests, or posting any other topics of discussion. New topics do not have to be technical in nature, and can be created as discussions open to other users or contributors.

To make posting issues as accessible as possible, we have provided forms for different types of issues. Following are brief instructions for using these forms and templates.
